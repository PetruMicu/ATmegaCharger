* main.c is the configuration file generated by AVR IDE.
    In function main ATmegaCharger must be called.
* ATmegaCharger.c is the main translation unit which links everything together.
    In function ATmegaCharger the superloop must be implemented.
* HW.c/HW.h is the pair of files which will contain the necessary elements in order to
communicate with the hardware (Current sensor, Temperature sensor, Relay control, Led control, etc...).
* LCD.c/LCD.h is the pair of files which will contain the wrapper over the existing LCD via TWI driver.
    In this file, functions like LCD_DisplayCharge, LCD_DisplayCurrent, etc. (still in progress)
* GPIO.c/GPIO.h is the pair of files which will contain the elements needed to drive GPIOs.
    (ADC also).


! Every function MUST have the following format:
            return_type FILENAME_Function();
! The correct way of placing brackets is the following (C style):
            structure
            {
                //write code
            }
